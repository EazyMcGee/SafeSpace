# SafeSpace

SafeSpace is a room booking system application that I've created that was to allow companies that had secluded rooms that could be utilised by staff during covid-19 social distancing allowing face-to-face meetings while maintaining safety checks and regulated tests.
The application allowed users (employees) to book a room that they could use for their teams or other employees to discuss work related projects while maintaining safety standards.


## Features

- Login System (Employee Credentials e.g. Username & Password)
- Cancellation/Reservation
- Safety Checks (COVID-19 Guidelines)
- Database connection (Locally tested)


## Requirements

    Visual Studio 2019/2022
    C# (.Net 4.8)
    WinForms
    SQL Server (SSMS)


## Important Notes

    For this application to run C# (.Net 4.8) must be installed alongside SSMS. 
    A connection string will be required to use a locally created database, which needs to be set up in the App.config file.
